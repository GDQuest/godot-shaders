Godot Shaders is a repository of Free shaders, part of which we made for our course [Godot Shader Secrets](https://gdquest.mavenseed.com/courses/shader-secrets-learn-to-code-2d-and-3d-shaders-in-godot).

## How to use

You can find the shaders in the `Shaders/` directory. Most shaders come with a demo scene. All demos are in the `Demos/` directory.

The `Intro/` directory contains an intro animation to the shader pipeline, that we use in our shader course.
